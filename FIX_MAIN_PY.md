# EMERGENCY FIX NEEDED

The last commit (6935fa1c5d89e2ae707c0a34d75fa855fa8307be) accidentally truncated app/main.py!

## TO FIX IN CURSOR:

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/scottmark12/newsletter-api-v2/commits/main
2. Find commit `97d9be424a2bad5cb3a4f666ed7fdfb14e2642d6` (the one BEFORE the bad commit)
3. Copy the full contents of `app/main.py` from that commit
4. Paste it into your local `app/main.py`
5. Then add the 4 new endpoints from `CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` after the `score_run` function
6. Commit and push

OR simpler - just revert the last commit:
```bash
git revert 6935fa1c5d89e2ae707c0a34d75fa855fa8307be
```

Then manually add the 4 endpoints from CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md to the restored file.

Sorry about that! The file got truncated accidentally when I tried to push through MCP.
